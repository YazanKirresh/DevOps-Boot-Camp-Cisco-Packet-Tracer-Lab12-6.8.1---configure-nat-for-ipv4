A) Use a named ACL to permit the addresses from LAN1, LAN2, and LAN3 to be translated. 
Specify the LANs in this order. Use the name R2NAT. 
The name you use must match this name exactly.

	ip access-list standard R2NAT
	 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
	 permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255
	 permit 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255
	exit

OR

	permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255

B) Create a NAT pool named R2POOL. The pool should use the first address from the 209.165.202.128/30 
address space. The pool name you use must match this name exactly. 
All translated addresses must use this address as their outside address.

	ip nat pool R2POOL 209.165.202.129 209.165.202.129 netmask 255.255.255.252

C) Configure NAT with the ACL and NAT pool that you have created.

	ip nat inside source list R2NAT pool R2POOL overload

D) Configure static NAT to map the local.pka server inside address to the 
second address from the 209.165.202.128/30 address space.

	ip nat inside source static 192.168.20.254 209.165.202.130

F) Configure the interfaces that will participate in NAT

	int S0/1/0
	ip nat outside
	exit
	int FA0/0
	ip nat inside
	exit
	int S0/0/0
	ip nat inside
	exit
	int S0/0/1
	ip nat inside
	exit
